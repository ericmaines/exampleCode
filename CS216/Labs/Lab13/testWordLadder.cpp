/*
 *course: CS216-00x
 *Project: Lab 13 (as part of Project 3)
 *Purpose: to demonstrate a simple Word Ladder, using four-letter words as examples 
 *         create a graph from given set of vertices and edges
 *         repeatedly ask the user to choose a source vertex(word1), then a destination vertex(word2) (type enter to quit)
 *         each vertex is labeled with a four-letter word. If two words are only different by a single letter, there is an edge between them.
 *         and calculate how many words on the "Word Ladder" from word1 to word2, 
 *         which is one more than the distance of the shortest path from the source(word1) to the destination(word2) in the Graph
 *         then display the "Word Ladder" from word1 to word2, which is
 *         the shortest path from the source to the destination in the Graph
 *         It is a sub-problem of Project 3.
