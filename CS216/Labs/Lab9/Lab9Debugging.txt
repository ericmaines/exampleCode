Instead of using cin, you need to use getline() to avoid ignoring the spaces in input

1. It displays the error multiple times because we are using cin as a way to get the input from the user. 
2. The first value is two, the second value is and, and the third value is one.
3. The solution would be to use getline() instead of cin and verify with cin.fail().
