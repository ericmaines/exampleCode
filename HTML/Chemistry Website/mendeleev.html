		<p>Dmitri Mendeleev was born in Russia in the 1800s.</p>
		<p>He lived in a time when most of the elements were being discovered and saw a need to organize them.</p>
		<p>Mendeleev noticed that the elements followed a trend that could be predicted. Elements behaved according to their mass size.</p>
		<p>People had tried to order the elements before Mendeleev, but they did not notice this trend in mass size. Mendeleev called this trend periodicity.</p>
		<p>One of the most amazing things Mendeleev did was predicting elements that had not yet been discovered!. This is because his table was extremely precise in predicting the properties of elements using the trend of periodicity.</p>
		<p>Mendeleev died in 1907, but his legacy lives on today through the periodic table!</p>
