			<p>The periodic table has undergone many changes as more elements have been added to the table over time. There used to be about 30 elements, but now there are 120!</p>
			<p>To account for these new elements, new groups have been added to the table to reflect the properties of the elements dicovered.</p>
			<p>Elements are not added very often, but when they are, it is a big deal! The most recent elements to be added were added in 2017 by IUPAC (The international union of pure and applied chemistry). These elements completed the 7th row of the table. They are Tennessine, Oganesson, Nihonium, and Moscovium.</p>
			<p>Two of these elements wer discovered in Russia (Oganesson and Moscovium). Oganesson is the only element to have ever been named after a living person! Yuri Oganessian is the world's leading researcher on superheavy elements, and has discovered several with his team in Russia. Because of this, one of the elements recently added was named after him!</p>
