			<p>The periodic table is very useful in telling scientists about the properties of elements. They don't even need to have the element in front of them!</p>
			<p>Even for people who aren't scientists, the periodic table is very useful. One of the biggest uses ties together with how scientists use the table: properties of elements.</p>
			<p>For example: Americium is an element used in household smoke detectors. If you wanted to learn about the properties of Americium, you could look it up on the periodic table.</p>
			<p>From there, you would see that Americium is a pretty heavy element! You don't need much of it for it to start weighing a lot.</p>
			<p>You would also see that, like its neighbors, Americium is radioactive! But don't worry, the tiny amount that is in smoke detectors is completely safe for people!</p>
