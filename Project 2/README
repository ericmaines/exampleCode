This project requires you to run the .exe with the text files
I have included them along with the exe so you can run the finished product

This project focused on using functions and pass by reference in C++
The goal was to create a mini-MUD game similar in style to the text adventure games of the 80s
If you want to write your own story, just follow the format of the text files and the game will read it!

The longest game is Lunch, with DOG and CAT being intended for testing.
